# BAD_WebClient

This is the web client of BAD system. Learn more about Big Active Data(BAD) at [our site](http://asterix.ics.uci.edu/bigactivedata/).

## Introduction
Big Active Data (BAD) system is built by extending an existing scalable open-source BDMS (AsterixDB) in an active direction. 

## System Overview

Outside of the platform are the **Data Publishers** and **Data Subscribers**. Within the system itself, its components provide two broad areas of functionality â€“ BAD **Data Cluster** and BAD **Broker Network**.

* Data Publishers - Data sources from News Broadcasters, Government Agencies, Individuals and so on.
* Data Subscribers - End users of the system.
* Data Cluster - Big Data monitoring and management.
* Broker Network - notification management and distribution.

**Application Manager** (the third BAD users besides Publisher and Subscriber) will create and manage parameterized **Channels** that can be subscribed to in their application.

* Repetitive Channels - executes the channel function periodically and notifications contain the full results.
* Continuous Channel - executes whenever underlying data sets change and notifications contain the differential results.

## User Experience

Suscriber users can subscribe to channels created by Manager users, in which data are provided by Publisher users. 

* index - login and register page
* notifications - newsfeed
* subscriptions - reports and location subscriptions
* preferences - preference settings
